### Date Bingo
Date Bingo creates a fun and engaging way to discover new date ideas with your partner and create awesome memories. It was created for couples or friends that are looking to have a good time in their relationship and improve closeness with their partners. Date Bingo was originally inspired by scratch-off date books, but it's completely free! Some features of Date Bingo include: a weather API so you can plan your activities around the sun, a cute and interactive bingo card, a photo gallery where you can upload pictures of your dates, and a pink theme that gives it a modern and whimsical feel. Date Bingo utilizes firebase's storage and database features in order to upload images. The site also uses a sing-up/login system created with firebase in order to customize each users photo gallery (in the future). Please refer to the Privacy Policy with any queries and feel free to contact me as well. Date Bingo is a work in progress and contributions are encouraged!
